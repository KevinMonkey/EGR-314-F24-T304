## 📖 **Problem Statement**  
The problem we chose to address is that the environment can change unpredictably while operating a drone and hobbyist drones are less equipt to handle extreme weather. This causes the drone to be subjected to hazardous conditions or to get lost. By developing a station to house the drone and communicate data in real-time to the user we hope to minimize the risks involved in operating hobbyist drones.
